# ü¶∑ Dental Caries & Periapical Lesion Detection using YOLOv8

This repository contains a complete pipeline for training a YOLOv8-based object detection model to identify **dental caries** and **periapical lesions** in dental radiographs.

## üìê Model Architecture & Reasoning

We used the [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://docs.ultralytics.com) object detection architecture:
- Variant: `YOLOv8m` (Medium)
- Chosen for its trade-off between accuracy and training efficiency
- Pretrained on COCO for better convergence on small medical dataset

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset & Preprocessing

- Source: Roboflow project ([ADR version 7](https://universe.roboflow.com/new-workspace-oorwh/adr))
- Format: YOLOv8 (includes train/val/test split)
- Classes: 
  - `Dental Caries`
  - `Periapical Lesion`

### Preprocessing:
- Cropped out black borders from X-rays
- Applied **CLAHE** (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)
- Resized to 640√ó640 with padding
- Converted to grayscale (1-channel input)
